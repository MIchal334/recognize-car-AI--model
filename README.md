# Recognize car model

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple codebase for training a machine learning model to detect whether a car is present in an image. The model is built using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, and is trained on a dataset of images to learn how to classify whether a car is present in each image.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Networks for image classification
